# Changelog

All notable changes to omux are listed here. Versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-10-28

### Added

- **Worktree sessions** (⌥⌘T). A session can get its own Git branch and folder, next to the repo in `<repo>.worktrees/<branch>`, so parallel sessions don't touch each other's files. A project setting makes it the default for new sessions. Right-click a worktree session to create a pull request, merge it into its base branch or open its folder. Closing one asks whether to keep or delete the worktree.
- **Tabs in the right panel:** Files (⌥⌘1), Changes (⌥⌘2) and Browser (⌥⌘3).
- **Changes tab.** Shows the session's diff: against the base branch for worktree sessions, uncommitted changes otherwise. Click a line to leave a note, then send all notes to Claude in one message.
- **Browser tab.** A web view per session that opens the local server the session prints, such as `localhost:3000`. The pick button adds an element's HTML, styles and a screenshot to the prompt.
- **Allow and Deny** in the sidebar and the session header when Claude asks for a tool permission, so you can answer without switching sessions.
- **Subagents.** The selected session lists its running subagents and what each one is doing. Other sessions show a count. The header's agents button lists them all, and clicking one opens its live transcript.

### Fixed

- Restarting a session could mark it as stopped when the old terminal's exit arrived after the new one started.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-27

First public release.

- Projects and sessions in a sidebar, with drag to reorder, rename and colors.
- Claude conversations that resume after you quit and reopen omux.
- Live status for each session (working, needs you, done) and a Dock badge for sessions waiting on you.
- Files panel that previews Markdown, code and text, images, PDFs, audio, video and anything Quick Look can show.
- Recent Claude conversations (⇧⌘O), Claude plan usage limits in the sidebar, themes, terminal font settings and a quick switcher (⌘K).
- Open folders from Finder's "Open in omux" service, the Dock icon or `open -a omux <folder>`.
